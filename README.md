## Problem <a name="problem"></a>
### Design a RESTful API for an online bookstore which can be used to manage different products.

* Details: Implementation of a RESTful API for an online store. It would support addition, deletion, editing and searching a book. It will also support authentication (only authenticated users can add / view / edit / delete items). This API is created speculatively for a web developer who will use it to create a website. There are some example scenarios included along with the expected request / response objects.
